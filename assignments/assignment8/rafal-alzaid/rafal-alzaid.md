During this assignment I faced a lot of challenges that simultaneously allowed me to learn a lot. These are the following challenges and how I managed to overcome them:
	- Tiny
	Initially tiny would not work for some reason despite me doing all of the necessary steps. I was just worried my computer wouldn't handle it. During that process Urvashi advised me to just try small, which ended up working.
	- Localhost issues
	The following challenge I encounter was the localhost connectivity issue, so I changed the port in the python file in hopes that it would work, and it did.
	- FFMPEG
	Additionally, I had to pip install the ffmpeg-python package because of an error I encountered, which also solved the issue.
	- JSON 
	Finally, there was some JSON issue with streamlit which prevented me from running the program.

I had been working on this for a while, and I was quite excited to make it work.But despite the challenges, I enjoyed the process nonetheless!
